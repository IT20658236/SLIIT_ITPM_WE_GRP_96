#Project Description
Food waste is a major problem that is closely related to responsible consumption and production. According to the statistics, one-third of all food produced in the world is lost or wasted causing significant economic, environmental, and social impacts. Most importantly food waste worsens social inequalities by limiting access to food for vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty or experiencing food insecurity. Since we are considering food wastage at the household level, a few of the main reasons for food waste are overbuying, lack of meal planning, impulse buying, misunderstanding expiration dates, and improper storage of food.
<ul>
  <li>We are planning to develop a food waste reduction web application that helps to spread awareness about managing food waste and promotes small food businesses. Ideally, it contains three main components.</li>
  <li>The first one is a recipe blog, which provides users with recipe ideas that make use of leftover ingredients, and articles and resources to educate users in meal planning, smart shopping, donations, and composting.</li>
  <li>The second one is a mini marketplace, where users can buy those foods.</li>
  <li>Third, we have planned a component that promotes and advertises businesses related to food made of leftover ingredients to encourage small businesses.</li>
</ul>
